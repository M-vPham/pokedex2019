# Pokedex (_more like a PokeGear instead_?)

## Project Setup

### Environment

_Recommended to use a Linux or Unix distro (OSX counts)_

- Install Git
  - you'll need it to contribute...
  - set up your git, this [article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) provides steps
- Install Node.js and npm
  - **recommendation**: install a node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) so it is easier to switch between different node versions
- Install a browser
  - any Chromium browser is a decent choice
  - for greater robust testing, install several different ones (Firefox, Safari, Edge, Chrome, etc.)
- _(Optional)_ Install Ruby for use with Sass
  - Sass is a css preprocessor, provides additional functionality to creating and managing stylesheets
  - **not being used in this project yet**, you'll have to set it up yourself if you want to use it

### Editor

_Recommended to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the rest of this section is setting up based on this editor._

#### Extensions

To complement the dependencies in use for this project, below are the recommended extensions to install in VS Code.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - code linter for JavaScript, no need to waste time on code standards, just focus on coding
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
  - opinionated code formatter, no need to argue about formatting of code, just focus on coding
- [Flow](https://flow.org/) Language Support
  - introduce static typing into JavaScript
  - bit more flexible than TypeScript
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for VS Code
  - this config helps maintains code styles across different editors
- Browser Preview
  - requires a chromium browser
  - allows previewing application within editor
- _(Optional)_ Git Lens
  - enhances the default VS Code git capability

#### _(Optional)_ Other

- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font is nice to work with, supports ligatures
- vscode-icons
  - extension which replaces the default file icons in VS Code
- Atom One Dark Theme
  - a theme close to VS Code's Dark+ theme but not as dark

## Create React App Generated Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
